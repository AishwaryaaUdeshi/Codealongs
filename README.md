# Codealongs
I made a repository with all my codealongs for my RISE project to make them more easily accessible! They were originally Repl.it notebooks, and the refugees forked them and wrote their code responses in the blanks. Make sure to download them instead of viewing them from the GitHub website to ensure that the formatting shows up properly.
