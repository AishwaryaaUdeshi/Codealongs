// Comparison Operators Codealong

// JavaScript gives us a way to compare values. Each expression below will be evaluated to a boolean, true or false:
// ⭐️ <, less than
// ⭐️ >, greater than
// ⭐️ <=, less than or equal to
// ⭐️ >=, greater than or equal to
// ⭐️ ===, is the same value and data type as
// ⭐️ !==, NOT the same value and data type as

// Notice the difference between === and =. === checks if two pieces of data are equal to each other. The assignment operator (=), assigns the value of a variable.
// 🌟 Let's try:


// 🌟 Let's define a variable for our birth month. 


// 🌟 Let's check to see if our birth month is the same as December


// 🌟 Now, let's work with numbers. Let's define a varable for your birth year. Then, make a second variable with the name nextYear!


// 🌟 Check to see if nextYear is greater than your birth year


// 🌟 Check to see if nextYear is not equal to your birth year 



// 🌟 Try-it #1 🌟  
// Declare two variables - firstName and age, and assign them to appropriate values. Now, check for the following things:
// 🌟 Is your name the same as "Karlie"?


// 🌟 Is your age the same as 15?


// 🌟 Is your age not the same as 15?


// 🌟 Is your age greater than 7?


// 🌟 Is your age less than or equal to 10?


// 🌟 Is your age less than or equal to 10?


// 🌟 What is the remainder when you age is divided by 2?


// ---------------🌟 CHALLENGE 🌟---------------
// Have you ever tried to create a password, but the application told you you need at least 8 characters? Time to solve a real-world challenge! Declare a new variable called fakePassword and assign it to a string of your choice. Then, check that the value stored in fakePassword is equal to or greater than 8 characters. Change the string that fakePassword is assigned to a couple times to make 100% sure it's working as expected.


// Need a hint? Use .length


// ---------------💪 LOGICAL OPERATORS 💪---------------
// Logical operators allow us to do some even more powerful work! They combine multiple comparison operators using:
// ⭐️ ||, OR
// ⭐️ &&, AND

// 🌟 What is the weather today? Write a variable for weather condition and temperature.


// 🌟 Check to see if the weather is sunny today.


// 🌟 Check to see if the temperature is above 80 degrees today.


// 🌟 Imagine that you only like hot AND sunny weather; how would you represent that?


// 🌟 Now imagine you changed your mind so that you like the weather when it's hot OR sunny and adjust your code accordingly.



// 🌟 Try-it #2 🌟
// Write code that satisfies each of the following scenarios, and remember to use console.log statements to check your outputs! Declare two variables - firstName and age, and assign them to appropriate values. 
// 🌟 Is your age less than 30 and greater than 10?


// 🌟 Is your age less than 20 or greater than 10?


// 🌟 Is your age exactly 15 or less than 18?


// 🌟 Is your age greater than 12 or exactly 14?


// 🌟 Is your age greater than 10 but not exactly 16?
