// Conditionals JavaScript Codealong
// ---------------ðŸ’ª Conditionals ðŸ’ª---------------

// Just like in real life, programming is full of decisions. We usually make decisions based on our current state or mood.

// A real-life example:
// Am I hungry?
// Yes âž¡ Iâ€™ll eat
// No âž¡ I wonâ€™t eat

// A programming example:
// Do you have an account?
// Yes âž¡ Please log in
// No âž¡ Please create an account


// ðŸŒŸ Create a new variable that defines bestArtist as your favorite artist.


// ðŸŒŸ Check to see if the condition is met & print "You are correct!" if true. 


// ðŸŒŸ If the condition is false, print "[Your favorite artist] is the best artist."

// if (condition) {
 // then this happens
// } else {
 // then this happens
// }

// We call this entire piece of code an if statement.
// Inside the parentheses after the keyword if, we have to give JavaScript an expression that can be evaluated as true or false. That expression is called a condition.
// If the condition evaluates to true, the code in the block below it will execute or run. It will then ignore the rest of the options.
// If it evaluates to false, it will check the condition in the next block.

// ðŸŒŸ What code would you write if you have two favorite artists?


// ðŸŒŸ Try-it #1 ðŸŒŸ
// Create a variable named luckyNumber and assign it to a number of your choice. Write an if statement checking if luckyNumber is less than 50, which if evaluated to true, prints out a sentence (you choose!). If it is evaluated to false, it should print out a different sentence. Use console.log statements to check your outputs!


// ---------------ðŸŒŸ CHALLENGE ðŸŒŸ---------------
// Using your luckyNumber, write a new conditional. If the lucky number equals 13, the output should be "You got it!". If it is too high, the output should be "Guess lower...", and it is too low, the output should be "Guess higher..."



// ---------------ðŸŒŸ EXTREME CHALLENGE ðŸŒŸ---------------
// Using your luckyNumber, write a new conditional. If the lucky number equals 13, the output should be "You got it!". If it is not, the output should be customized based on how far luckyNumber is from 13. There should be one output when the number is within 10 of 13, and one when there's a difference of more than 10. For example, if the number is 20, the output might be: "So close, you are just 7 off." If the number is 100, the output might be "Ouch you are not even close. Off by 87!"



// ðŸŒŸ Try-it #2 ðŸŒŸ
// Create a variable named favoriteFood and assign it to a string of your favorite food
// Write an if statement comparing your favorite to 'Smartfood', which if evaluated to true, prints out a sentence of your choice
// Write an else if statement comparing your favorite to 'Croissant', which if evaluated to true, prints out a sentence of your choice
// Write another else if - you choose what you compare it to
// Write an else statement that prints out a sentence of your choice
// Try changing the value of your favoriteFood variable to "Smartfood", then "Croissant" (if it wasn't already). Do you get what you expected?


// ---------------ðŸŒŸ CHALLENGE ðŸŒŸ---------------
// Write a program that checks a String. It should print to the console "even" if the number of characters in the text is even, and "odd" if the number of characters in the text is odd.


// ðŸŒŸ Extra Practice
// If the veggiesEaten is 5-9, print out a message of "Great job! You are within the recommended range!"
// Greater than 9? "WOW you really like veggies. Make sure you are getting enough protein."
// 1-4? "Uh oh, looks like you aren't getting enough veggies. You gotta do it!"
// 0? "We really need to make a plan to get you your veggies."
// Change the value stored in veggiesEaten a few times to make sure all of your conditions are working!
