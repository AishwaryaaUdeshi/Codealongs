// Intro to JavaScript CodeAlong

// ---------------💪 STRINGS 💪---------------
// 💥 String: A series of characters inside of double or single quotation marks. A String can be a word, a message, or a text you would type to your friends.

// 📝 console.log is used to print to the console to see if your code is working (not seen by the user!)


// 🌟 Try-it #1: Strings! 🌟
// console.log your name, age, and favorite food. Be sure to use quotes around your string!


// ❓ Can a string have spaces? Can a string have numbers? Can the letters be uppercase?


// ---------------💪 VARIABLES 💪---------------
// 📝 Variables can STORE any data type (String, number, etc.)
// 💥 Let's declare a variable: 

 
// 💥 After naming the variable, we use the = sign to show what value the variable will hold. In programming, we refer to the = as the assignment operator. 

// 💥 Don't forget your 🐫 camelCase 🐫! camelCase is a naming convention where the first word is lowercase and the following words are uppercase. Example: codingIsAwesome


// 🌟 Reassigning Variables 
//  To change the value of a variable, you do not need to declare it again 
// 💥 Let's reassign a variable:


//❓ How can we check to see what a variable is currently assigned as?


// 🌟 Try-it #2: Variables! 🌟
// Declare a variable for each of the following: 
  // favorite color
  // pet name
  // friend name
  // goals
  // hobby


// console.log each variable to check its value! Example: type console.log(favoriteColor) and run the code to see what is returned!


//❓ How would I re-assign the favoriteColor variable to a new string?


//🌟 Try-it #3: Reassigning Variables! 🌟
// Reassign pet name and hobby then console.log each variable to check to see if the value changed! 


//❓ How does order in the code predict which value the variable is currently assigned to?


// ---------------💪 INTERPOLATION 💪---------------
// Interpolation is when we use a variable in a String
// 💥 Interpolate by: 


// 🌟 Try-it #4: Interpolation 🌟
// Declare the following variables: 

var name1 = "Kit";
var name2 = "Kat";

// Use string interpolation to complete the following:
// 🌟 What code can you write to output the string "KitKat"?


// 🌟 What code can you write to output the string "KatKit"?


// 🌟 What code can you write to output the string "Kit Kat"?


// 🌟 What code can you write to output the string "Kat Kit Kat Kit"?


// 🌟 What code can you write to output the string "I love Kit Kat bars"?


// ---------------💪 NUMBERS 💪---------------
// 💥 Numbers: any numerical value (no quotations needed)
//  Example: 1, 2.535, 6.2

// JavaScript can perform math operations using these symbols:
  // ✖️ Multiplication → *
  // ➗ Division → /
  // ➕/➖ Addition/Subtraction → +, -
  // Modulus → % (finds the remainder)

  // 🌟 JavaScript follows the Order of Operations, which means parentheses follow PEMDAS!
// 💥 Let's try!


//❓ What would you expect this code to print to the console? console.log(7%2)

//❓ How could you use the % operator to check if a number is even or odd?


// ---------------💪 INCREMENTING VALUES 💪---------------
// Use += to increment up or -= to increment down
// 💥 Let's try!


//❓ When might incrementing up or down be useful in our code?


// 🌟 Try It #5: Numbers & Operators 🌟
// Start with these numbers:
var a = 12;
var b = 65;
var c= 31;
var d = 98;

// Write code to find the average of the four numbers above.


// ---------------🌟 CHALLENGE 🌟---------------
// On average, there are 23.5 students in your computer science class. If there are 36 computer science classes across all the schools in your district, how many computer science students are there in your district in total? Print your answer to the console in a complete sentence.
